## Intro :page_with_curl:

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

This first step will focus on building a basic console using the Cmd Python module, to handle objects of the project with methods to create, show, update, all and destroy the classes instances.
